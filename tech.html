<li>Colt M1911</li>
<br><p>Ace admits that even he needed a sidearm. The entire team often makes use of the ubiquitous Colt M1911 pistol as an effective sidearm. To aid in stealth missions, the Athena and Ace's Colts are painted a flat-matte black finish to avoid glare. Ace often dual-wields suppressed Colts for double the close-range defense.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=27">IMI Desert Eagle<a/></li>

<li>IMI Desert Eagle</li>
<br><p>Zyril's favorite sidearm. The pistol known all over the world for having the largest centerfire cartridge of any known sidearm. Zyril and Gneiss' sidearms utilize the .50 Action Express round, with a Titanium Gold finish.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=441">H&K UMP<a/></li>
<img src="UMP.jpg">
<li>H&K UMP</li>
<br><p>Ace's favorite close-in weapon. The H&K UMP utilizes the .45 ACP round found in the M1911 for more stopping power against targets, although it decreases with range. Like most of his weapons, Ace's UMP is flat black and suppressed.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=377">Mk. 14 Mod O DMR<a/></li>
<img src="M14 EBR.jpg">
<li>Mk. 14 Enhaced Battle Rifle</li>
<br><p>As the team's designated Marksman, Ace uses an M14 EBR for both high and low profile ops. The rifle uses a 7.62x15 mm. NATO cartridge, and typical of the sniper, has a flat black finish with a suppressor.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=7">FN M240 Squad Support Weaon<a/></li>
<img src="M240.jpg">
<li>FN M240 Squad Assault Weapon</li>
<br><p>"Quad-Fifty"'s favorite. The best choice for a light-yet-powerful squad support weapon. The M240 fires 7.62 NATO catridges, allowing for flexibility in combat. Isabelle's upgrades augmented its accuracy with an ACOG scope.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=19">Kalashnikova AK-47<a/></li>
<img src="AK.jpg">
<li>Kalashnikova AK-47</li>
<br><p>Gneiss' weapon of choice for Assault techniques. AK's ease of maintenance, reliability and stopping power (provided by its 7.62x39 mm cartridge), coupled with and ACOG scope and an underbarrel Grenade Launcher.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=243">M134 Minigun<a/></li>
<img src="M134.jpg">
<li>M134 Minigun</li>
<br><p>Zyril's primary weapon of choice. This beast is a six-barrelled, Gatling-style, rifled machine gun that fires 7.62x51 mm. NATO cartridge. Zyril often augments its intense rate of fire (6,000 rpm) with APHEI (Armor-Piercing-High-Explosive-Incendiary) bullets, useful for thin-skinned APC's or Attack Helicopters.</p> 
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Combat_Optical_Gunsight">Trijcon Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight</a></li>
<img src="ACOG.jpg">
<li>Trijcon ACOG</li>
<br><p>The team's favorite rifle scope. Its durability is favored by Gneiss and its reliability by Ace.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.military.com/video/ammunition-and-explosives/explosives/c4-explained/1367499806001">C4 Plastic Explosive<a/></li>
<img src="c4.jpg">
<li>C4 Explosive</li>
<br><p>The team's favorite demolition tool. Ace is known to use Symtex-H for making vehicle traps, often throwing off batches in chases, then detonating it to destroy pursuing vehicles.</p>
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=661">GP-25 Ostyor Underbarrel Grenade Launcher</a></li>
<img src="gp25.jpg">
<li>GP-25 Grenade Launcher</li>
<br><p>Gneiss' favorite tool for flushing out hardpoints in enemy defenses. Very effective in creeping Ace out.</p>
