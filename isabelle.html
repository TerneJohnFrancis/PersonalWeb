<br><p>Name: Cornelia Isabelle Satory Lucent</p>
<ul><br><p>Role: Infantry Support Trooper/ Light Anti- Vehicle Trooper</p>
<br><p>Rank: 2nd Lieutenant</p>
<br><p>Callsign: Lima-02</p>
<br><p>Status: Alive</p>
<br><p>Backstory:</p>
</ul>
<li>Early Life and Training</li>
<br><p>Not much is known about the resident light support trooper. Legend has it that Isabelle was trained by her father after he saw her pelt rocks endlessly at the boys her brother brawled with on the street with one day.</p>
<li>Career</li>
<br><p>During the events on Schwefel, Isabelle came to Ace and Koslov's aid. As she was already in gear, she immediately opened fire on advancing HoD terrorists, stalling them enough to give Zyril time to prep his weapons.</p>
<li>Manning the guns</li>
<br><p>After the team obtained a new tank, Ace immediately worked on it to prepare for their next destination: Somalia. Although it wasn't ready yet, Isabelle and Ace manage to fire up the weapon systems. Spotting an attack chopper, Ace opened fire instead on the incoming infantry, forcing Isabelle to use the "Stingers". She later attended Koslov's funeral at the Petrograd Military Memorial.</p>
