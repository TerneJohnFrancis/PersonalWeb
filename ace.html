<<br><p>Name: Ace Licinius Satory Lucent</p>
<ul><br><p>Role: Designated Scout/Marksman</p>
<br><p>Rank: 1st Lieutenant</p>
<br><p>Callsign:Lima-05</p>
<br><p>Status: Alive</p>
<br><p>Backstory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Life:</li>
<br><p>Born the third child of August and Cortana Lucent, Ace lacked his brother's footspeed and strength, his older sister's endurance or his younger sister's agility and charm. He did, however, possess a prowess with his great-grandfather's Gewehr 98 rifle, as well as his father's M1911. Seeing the potential his son had as a sniper, August sought to train the wily marksman in the art of field recon, camouflage and deflection shooting.</p>
<li>Early Career</li>
<br><p>For a while, it looked like Ace's lessons would never be put to use. But during his brother's service in Ukraine, he also fought against the "Hand of Death" in his local area. His initiation into the world his brother had entered occured when the local "Hand of Death" cell began an assault on the city, forcing Ace to come to the aid of the local police. Using the skills his father taught him, he eliminated many HoD terrorists, picking them off, one by one.</li>
<li>Schwefel</li>
<br><p>Unfortunately, August and Cortana's untimely deaths forced him to join his siblings. The seeds of what would become the 1st Tactical Strike Group would be sown. During Operation: Schwefel, he worked with Gneiss and Koslov to get to Ground Zero, where he collected a sample of the weapon known as Brimstone.</li>
<li>Somalia</li>
<br><p>During the battle of Somalia, Ace positioned himself on a building's rooftop, picking off anyone who got in his sights. It was also there when he first tested his then-new M41A7 Bulldog tank. Although his opponent was in fact, a Soviet-built T-72, positioned on a hill, he managed to snipe it with the untested Rheinmetall cannon on his tank from a distance of 965 meters.</p>
