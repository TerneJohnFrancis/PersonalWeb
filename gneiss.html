<br><p>Name: Gneiss Ferdinand Satory Lucent</p>
<ul><br><p>Role: Assault Trooper/ Commander</p>
<br><p>Rank: Captain</p>
<br><p>Callsign: Lima-01</p>
<br><p>Status: Alive</p>
<br><p>Backstory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Life:</li>
<br><p>Gneiss Ferdinand Satory Lucent is the oldest child of August and Cortana Lucent, both distinguished military officers. As a result, the future captain's disciplinary training began at a tender age. Eight years old to be exact. At twelve years old, he was trained to do 200+ push-ups, curl-ups and to do 30 minutes of planking a day. Due to his parent's prestige and influence, as well as his physical fitness, he was selected for the first batch of graduates for Project: Vanguard.</p>
<li>Early Career</li>
<br><p>During his training at Project: Vanguard, he befriended then Cadet Romeo Valentin Koslov, and was subsequently joined by his later squad, the future 33rd Strike Battalion.During training, he was promoted to Staff Sergeant, commanding Charlie Squad. It was also during his "Vanguard" days when he first demostrated his unique footspeed and leadership skills. As a result, he graduated from the Project as a member of the elite "33rd" Special Forces.</p>
<br><p>His first taste of action was during the Baltic Crisis. At the time, his younger siblings Ace and Athena were in high school. He was acting as a part of the security detail that escorted the Ukrainian ambassador, when several armed men opened fire on them. Although they saved the ambassador, many of the 33rd, including Koslov's cousin, were killed by either shrapnel or rocket fire. As a result, they had to be withdrawn on the local security chief's orders. Gneiss realized, however, after looking at the security chief was accepting payment to give the armed men, known members of the terrorist group "Hand of Death", a free rein. Gneiss interrogated the chief, and together with Koslov and those loyal to him, assaulted the HoD HQ. Despite their losses, they manage to capture the terrorist leader and establish his link to the opposing nation's ambassador, relieving the local populace and the region.</p>
<li>Being with the "1st"</li>
<br><p>A couple of years after the "Baltic Crisis", Gneiss received a surprise: both his parents were dead after the commercial airliner they boarded disintigrated midair, and that his three siblings and cousin were now under his command. As usual, Koslov stuck with him, as his second-in-command. </p>
<li>"Operation:Schwefel"
<br><p>Desperate to prove that their parents' death was a set-up, the 1st head to the crash site, codenamed "Schwefel", or Brimstone, to look for evidence. With Athena working to distract the guards, Gneiss, Koslov and Ace head to ground zero, codenamed "Boden Null".There they find the evidence that the plane did not suffer mechanical failure, but was in fact, detonated. Suspecting the "Hand of Death" to be once again involved, Gneiss went to weapons dealer Ymir Kraschnev, a man he once crossed paths with in Ukraine during the Crisis, to know whether he was familiar with the explosive. Kraschnev, familiar with Gneiss' cruelty when angered, readily gave him the answer: a militarized Sulfuric Acid solution, used to rapidly corrode metals, mixed with an ounce of TNT. The acid gave off the odor that would give the crash site its name.</p>
<li>Say hello to "Death"</li>
<br><p>Shortly after the events in Schwefel, Gneiss goes solo in Somalia. His search inevitably leads to Koslov's death at the hands of the man known as Abu Shakar, a.k.a. "Death".
