<br><p>Backstory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Life</li>
<br><p>Zyril Magnus Satory was an outgoing child until his parents died in the line of duty in the remote Siberian Tundra. As a result, he was raised by his aunt Cortana, and so lived in the same house with the four for six years.</p>
<li>Career</li>
<br><p>As time progressed, Zyril was also continually being trained by his uncle August as a Heavy Support Trooper, specializing in Heavy Assault tactics and Anti-Vehicle Support.</p>
<li>Battle for Somalia</li>
<br><p>During the ensuing firefight after the flare gun misfire, Zyril, having learned from Schwefel, immediately fired up his M134 Minigun and mowed down every enemy in front of him.</p>
