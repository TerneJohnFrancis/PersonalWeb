<h2><center>Team Vehicles</center></h2>

<br><p>During the early days, the team continually utilized the reliable FMC M113 APC for military operations, such as search-and-rescue, urban warfare operations or the occasional siege. The team's APC uses a twin-mount M2HB with a TOW missile for AT capabilities, coupled with Explosive-Reactive Armor (ERA) blocks and a trophy system for advanced defense.</p>
<li>AMG HMMWV "Humvee"</li>

<br><p>For missions that require more mobility and flexibility, the 1st often utilizes requisitioned "Humvees" as transport and logistics support vehicles, but are mostly used by the unit as an assault vehicle.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_US/Motorcycles/v-rod.html">V-Rod</a></li>
<br><p>The captain's favorite, as the V-Rod offers unique maneuverability, speed and reduced target silhouette that only motorbikes could present. The team known to use modified V-Rod's as Assault Vehicles, sporting everything from .50 cal. MGs to 40 mm. AT rockets.</p>
<li>Hughes OH-6 "Cayuse" Chopper</li>
<img src="OH-6.jpg">
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=830">OH-6</a></li>
<br><p>A "Low-Observation Helicopter" that is capable of being a troop transport, attack chopper and recon vehicle. Favored by "Tank" for its guns and "Five-Bullet Ace" for its recon capability.</p>
<li>M41 "Walker Bulldog" Scout Tank</li>
<img src="M41.jpg">
<li><a href="http://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=32">M41</a></li>
<br><p>As his name suggests, "Tank" absolutely loves this vehicle. Although it was first introduced during the Korean War, Ace's tech upgrades keep it up with modern MBT standards. The team's M41 tank sports a German -built Rheinmetall L/44 cannon, and Chobham composite armor combined with ERA to help protect against a wide variety of weapons.</p>
