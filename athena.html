<ul><br><p>Role: Covert Operative</p>
<br><p>Rank: Staff Sergeant</p>
<br><p>Callsign: Lima-04</p>
<br><p>Status: Alive</p>
<br><p>Backstory:</p>
<li>Early Life</li>
<br><p>Athena was in essence, a younger version of her mother. She was at times lady-like, but had the capacity to defend herself and others. During her childhood, she was especially close with her brother Ace, who would often bring her snacks and help her on homework.</p>
<li>Project:Gala</li>
<br><p>Due to her level of experience in multi-language communication, martial arts and marksmanship, Athena was selected for Batch #4 of the Army's Project: Gala. Although disdained by the other trainees at first, they came to respect her skill and leadership, traits that Lucents are supposed to have.</li>
<li>Somalia</li>
<br><p>Despite the team's best efforts, their postion was still under heavy enemy fire. Athena immediately sent a distress signal to the local Russian garrison, wherein she requested a Close-Air-Support (CAS) package. As a result, the team escaped their boxed in position and was able to escape.</p>
